# tkdkid1000-website
My website. Decided to move from static (github pages) to a new approach!
I'll host things like public forums and stuff here.

### Building
To use this site is simple, just run `npm run build`, then start the server with `./bin/www`.
You can edit the config file directly from `./src/config.json` before building, or in `./target/config.json` after building.
