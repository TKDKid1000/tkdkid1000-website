# tkdkid1000-website

I completely redesigned it (yet again). I removed the original express based version that had some major security issues.

This new system is designed around [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). I wanted to redesign it around React, but decided instead to just rewrite it.

I have removed some of the major features like the forums for now, if I want to, I will add it back once I have time. This new website has a blog and a (WIP) comments system.

## Building

You can build this site yourself, but it requires a bit of setup.
